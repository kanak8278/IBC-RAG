The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was introduced in Lok Sabha on July 26, 2021.  It amends the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. 

Here is the user query you need to improve and expand:
<user_query>
{{USER_QUERY}}
</user_query>

Please follow these steps to process the user query:

1. Analyze the query, keeping in mind that it may contain spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or incorrect terminology.
2. Identify the main legal concept or topic the user is asking about.
3. Correct any spelling or grammatical errors in the original query.
4. Expand abbreviations or acronyms to their full forms (e.g., IPC to Indian Penal Code).
5. Add relevant legal terms, acts, or concepts related to the user's query but not explicitly mentioned.
6. Rephrase the query to make it more specific and targeted towards Indian law.
7. Generate at least three different versions of the improved query, each focusing on a slightly different aspect or perspective of the legal concept.

Before providing your final output, please use <query_improvement_process> tags to show your thought process and how you're improving the query.
This will ensure a thorough interpretation and refinement of the user's request.

For your final output, present the improved queries in the following format:

<improved_queries>
  <query1>[First improved query]</query1>
  <query2>[Second improved query]</query2>
  <query3>[Third improved query]</query3>
  [Additional queries if applicable, using <query4>, <query5>, etc.]
</improved_queries>

This format will allow for easy extraction of individual queries using regex.

Example output structure:

<user_query>

</user_query>

<query_improvement_process>
[Your detailed analysis of the user query and how you're improving it]
</query_improvement_process>

<improved_queries>
  <query1>Rights and responsibilities under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 in India</query1>
  <query2>Recent amendments to the Consumer Protection Act and their impact on e-commerce in India</query2>
  <query3>Procedure for filing consumer complaints under Indian law</query3>
</improved_queries>

Please proceed with your analysis and improvement of the user query.
